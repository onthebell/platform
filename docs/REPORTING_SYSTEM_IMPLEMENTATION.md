# Reporting System Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive content reporting system for the
OnTheBell community platform, allowing users to report inappropriate posts and
comments for moderation review.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed Features

  users
- **Comment Component**: Added report button next to edit/delete buttons for
  non-author users

  posts

#### 2. **Existing Infrastructure Utilized**

The project already had a robust reporting system in place, including:

- **ReportButton Component** (`/src/components/moderation/ReportButton.tsx`)
- **ReportModal Component** (`/src/components/moderation/ReportModal.tsx`)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/report` - Submit new reports
  - `/api/admin/reports` - Admin report management
- **Admin Interface** (`/src/components/admin/AdminReports.tsx`)
- **Database Schema**: `contentReports` collection with proper indexes
- **Content Moderation**: Integration with OpenAI moderation API

#### 3. **User Experience Features**
