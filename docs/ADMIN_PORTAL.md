## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Firebase Admin SDK
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}
# OR
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# OpenAI for content moderation (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MODERATION_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

1. Enable Firebase Admin SDK in your project
2. Create a service account with Firestore permissions
3. Download the service account key
4. Add the key to environment variables

### 3. Firestore Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore rules allow admin operations:

```javascript
// Admin operations
allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
  resource.data.role in ['admin', 'super_admin'];

// Report submissions
allow create: if request.auth != null &&
  request.auth.uid == resource.data.reporterId;
```

### 4. User Role Assignment

Assign initial admin roles in Firestore:

```javascript
// In Firestore Console or admin script
await firestore
  .collection('users')
  .doc(userId)
  .update({
    role: 'admin',
    permissions: [
      'manage_posts',
      'manage_users',
      'manage_reports',
      'view_analytics',
    ],
  });
```

## Usage

### Accessing the Admin Portal

1. Navigate to `/admin` (requires admin role)
2. Dashboard shows overview of community activity
3. Use sidebar navigation to access different sections

### Content Moderation Workflow

1. **Reports**: Users report inappropriate content
2. **Review**: Admins review reports in `/admin/reports`
3. **Action**: Take appropriate moderation action
4. **Resolution**: Report marked as resolved with notes

### User Management

1. **View Users**: Browse all users with filters
2. **Role Management**: Assign roles and permissions
3. **Suspensions**: Temporarily suspend users with reasons
4. **Activity**: Track user actions and history

## Security Considerations

- Secure admin activity logging
- Audit trails for all actions

### API Security

## Development

### Testing

```bash
# Run admin portal tests
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=admin

# Test role-based access
npm run test -- useAdmin.test.ts
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start with admin portal enabled
npm run dev

# Access admin portal
open http://localhost:3000/admin
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build with admin features
npm run build

# Verify admin routes are protected
npm run start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Admin access required" error**

   - Check user role in Firestore
   - Verify Firebase Admin SDK configuration
   - Ensure proper authentication headers

2. **Reports not loading**

   - Check Firestore permissions
   - Verify report collection structure
   - Review console for API errors

3. **Statistics not updating**
   - Check Firestore query limits
   - Verify date range calculations
   - Review dashboard API response

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```javascript
// In admin hooks
const DEBUG_MODE = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
if (DEBUG_MODE) console.log('Admin operation:', data);
```
